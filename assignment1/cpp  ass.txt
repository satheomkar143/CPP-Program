1)Write a Cpp program to accept the height of a person in centimeter
 and categorize the person according to their height

Height < 150.0                                       The person is Dwarf.
 Height >= 150.0 && Height < 165.0  the person is  average heighted.
Height >= 165.0) && (Height <= 195.0 he person is taller
otherwise  Abnormal height.
=====================================================
2)Write a Cpp program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature 
state below : Go to the editor
Temp < 0 then Freezing weather
Temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
Temp 10-20 then Cold weather
Temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
Temp 30-40 then Its Hot
Temp >=40 then Its Very Hot.

====================================================
3)Conditional Statement: Exercise-14 with Solution
Write a Cpp program to check whether a triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene.

Equilateral triangle: An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. 
In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles
 are also congruent to each other and are each 60°.

Isosceles triangle: An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length.

Scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides, such as those illustrated above.

================================================

4)Write a Cpp program to check whether a triangle can be formed by the given value for the angle
=========================================
5)
Write a program in Cpp to calculate and print the Electricity bill 
of a given customer. The customer id., name and unit consumed by 
the user should be taken from the keyboard and display the total 
amount to pay to the customer. The charge are as follow :

Unit	Charge/unit
upto 199	@1.20
200 and above but less than 400	@1.50
400 and above but less than 600	@1.80
600 and above	@2.00
If bill exceeds Rs. 400 then a surcharge of 15% will be charged and the minimum bill should be of Rs. 100/-
