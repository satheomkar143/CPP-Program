1) Write a C++ program using class which contains two data members of type integer. 
Create and initialize the object using default constructor, parameterized constructor and 
parameterized constructor with default value. Write a member function to display maximum
 from given two numbers for all objects.

2)C++ Program to calculate Volume of Cube using constructor  .

3)C++ Program to calculate Volume of Cube using constructor  .

4)Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more 
amount to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value 
of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Piggie Bank.

5)C++ program to Display Student Details using constructor and destructor.

6)C++ Program to Display Date using Constructors 

7)C++ Program to Show Counter using Constructor

8)Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, 
then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, 
then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.
For example, while creating the object if we pass "cpp", then "I love cpp" should be printed.
